Bottle Warmer Arduino Shield Library

Usage: 

put files into a folder called bwas in your Arduino/libraries folder
 (easiest to just do your git clone there)
get my ArduinoThermistor library in the same way.

Import both libraries using Arduino's Sketch -> Import Library...

You can also check out the example using File -> Examples -> bwas -> bwasMenu
